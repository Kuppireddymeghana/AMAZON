        <p>Aloe vera [3] is a succulent plant species of the genus Aloe.[4] It is widely distributed, and is considered an invasive species in many world regions.[4][5]
            <br>
<br>
            An evergreen perennial, it originates from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a>, but grows wild in tropical, semi-tropical, and arid climates around the world.[4] It is cultivated for commercial products, mainly as a topical treatment used over centuries.[4][5] The species is attractive for decorative purposes, and succeeds indoors as a potted plant.[6]
            <br>
<br>           
            It is used in many consumer products, including beverages, skin lotion, cosmetics, ointments or in the form of gel for minor burns and sunburns. There is little clinical evidence for the effectiveness or safety of Aloe vera extract as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics">cosmetic</a> or topical drug.[5][7] The name derives from Latin as aloe and vera ("true").</p>

        <h2>Etymology and Common Names</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The botanical name derives from Latin, aloe (also from Greek), having uncertain origin, and vera ("true") from Latin.[8] Common names use aloe with a region of its distribution, such as Chinese aloe, Cape aloe or Barbados aloe</p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Aloe vera is a stemless or very short-stemmed plant growing to 60–100 centimetres (24–39 inches) tall, spreading by offsets.[4] The leaves are thick and fleshy, green to grey-green, with some varieties showing white flecks on their upper and lower stem surfaces.[11] The margin of the leaf is serrated and has small white teeth. The flowers are produced in summer on a spike up to 90 cm (35 in) tall, each flower being pendulous, with a yellow tubular corolla 2–3 cm (3⁄4–1+1⁄4 in) long.[11][12] Like other Aloe species, Aloe vera forms arbuscular mycorrhiza, a symbiosis that allows the plant better access to mineral nutrients in soil.[13]
            <br>
<br>
            Aloe vera leaves contain phytochemicals under study for possible bioactivity, such as acetylated mannans, polymannans, anthraquinone C-glycosides, anthrones, and other anthraquinones, such as emodin and various lectins.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<hr>
<p>Two substances from Aloe vera – a clear gel and its yellow latex – are used to manufacture commercial products.[7][34] Aloe gel typically is used to make topical medications for skin conditions, such as burns, wounds, frostbite, rashes, psoriasis, cold sores, or dry skin.[7][34] Aloe latex is used individually or manufactured as a product with other ingredients to be ingested for relief of constipation.[7][34] Aloe latex may be obtained in a dried form called resin or as "aloe dried juice".[48]
    <br>
    <br>
There is conflicting evidence regarding whether Aloe vera is effective as a treatment for wounds or burns.[5][34] There is some evidence that topical use of aloe products might relieve symptoms of certain skin disorders, such as psoriasis, acne, or rashes.[7][34]
    <br>
    <br>
    Aloe vera gel is used commercially as an ingredient in yogurts, beverages, and some desserts,[49] but at high or prolonged doses, ingesting aloe latex or whole leaf extract can be toxic.[7][5][10] Use of topical aloe vera in small amounts is likely to be safe.</p>
